        <h4>Hannibal's Campaign</h4>
        <div class="textright1">
            Hannibal’s campaign in the Second Punic War remains one of history's boldest military feats. Determined to challenge Rome, he led his army from Spain, across the Alps, and into Italy, overcoming immense odds and heavy losses. Once in Italy, he achieved major victories at Trebia, Lake Trasimene, and Cannae, where his tactical brilliance shocked Rome and left a lasting mark on military strategy. For over a decade, Hannibal maintained his army in Italy, rallying local allies and avoiding Roman defeat despite limited support from Carthage. Eventually, however, Rome’s resilience and strategic pressure on Carthage forced Hannibal to return home, where he was defeated by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE, ending Carthage’s challenge to Rome. His campaign transformed the art of war and is remembered for its innovation and boldness.
