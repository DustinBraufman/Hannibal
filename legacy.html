      <h3>Rome's Terror</h3>
      <div class="textright">Hannibal’s campaigns left a lasting terror on Rome, as his tactics and victories, especially at Cannae, became legendary for their devastating impact. His ability to bring the war to Rome’s doorstep created a fear that haunted the Roman psyche for generations, leading to the phrase Hannibal ad portas ("Hannibal is at the gates") to express imminent danger. Even after his defeat, Roman leaders cited his tactics and legacy in military training and strategy. His reputation endured, influencing Rome's approach to security and expansion long after his death.</div>

        <h2>Military Influence</h2>
        <div class="textleft">Hannibal revolutionized ancient warfare with his innovative tactics, particularly his use of ambushes, strategic feints, and the effective integration of diverse forces. His victory at Cannae, where he encircled and annihilated a much larger Roman army, became a model for military tactics and is still studied in military academies today. His campaigns demonstrated the power of strategy over sheer numbers, influencing military thinking across cultures and eras. Hannibal's legacy reshaped the art of warfare, showing that creativity and adaptability could redefine the battlefield.</div>

        <h3>Effect on Carthage</h3>
        <div class="textright">Hannibal’s influence on Carthage was profound, both in his lifetime and long after. His ambitious campaigns against Rome showcased Carthage’s military potential but ultimately strained its resources, leading to economic hardship and political divisions. Though his efforts inspired loyalty and pride, Carthage’s eventual defeat in the Second Punic War marked a turning point, limiting its power and autonomy under Roman terms. Hannibal's legacy became a double-edged sword for Carthage, embodying both its resilience and the costs of prolonged conflict with Rome.</div>
