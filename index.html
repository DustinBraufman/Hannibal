      <h3>Hannibal Barca</h3>
      <div class="textright">Hannibal Barca (247–183 BCE) was a brilliant Carthaginian general and military strategist, best known for his role in the Second Punic War against Rome. Born in Carthage (modern-day Tunisia) to the military commander Hamilcar Barca, Hannibal grew up amid intense hostility toward Rome. He famously led his army, including war elephants, across the Alps to surprise the Romans in Italy—a bold maneuver that secured him significant victories, including the crushing defeat of Roman forces at the Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE. Hannibal’s tactics and battlefield prowess earned him a lasting reputation as one of history’s greatest military minds. After years of struggling against Rome, he fled Carthage and spent his final years advising other kingdoms, continuing to oppose Roman expansion until his death.</div>

        <div class="textright">Hannibal Barca, son of the Carthaginian general Hamilcar, is best known for his military campaigns during the Second Punic War against Rome. Little is known about his personal life, though he had a wife and later served as a statesman. After Carthage's defeat, he died in exile, likely by suicide, around 183 BCE.</div>
