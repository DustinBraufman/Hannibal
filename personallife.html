        <h2>Hamilcar and Hannibal</h2>
        <div class="textleft"> Hamilcar Barca was a prominent Carthaginian general who fought in the First Punic War and later led campaigns in Spain, expanding Carthaginian territory. He instilled a deep sense of military discipline and a hatred for Rome in his son Hannibal, pushing him to swear an oath of eternal enmity against the Romans at a young age. Hamilcar's strategies and emphasis on military excellence heavily influenced Hannibal’s approach to warfare, particularly his use of tactics and reliance on his diverse army. His legacy shaped Hannibal’s worldview and ambition, playing a crucial role in his eventual leadership in the Second Punic War.</div>

      <h3>Imicile</h3>
      <div class="textright">Imilce was a Spanish princess and the wife of Hannibal, though little is known about her life beyond her marriage. Hamilcar Barca is believed to have arranged the marriage, likely to solidify alliances with local tribes in Spain and strengthen his military position. Imilce’s influence on Hannibal remains unclear, but her marriage to him symbolized the unity between Carthage and the Iberian tribes. Her role, though largely overshadowed by Hannibal’s military career, may have played a part in his early leadership and strategies in the region.</div>

        <h2>Statesman</h2>
        <div class="textleft"> After the Second Punic War, Hannibal returned to Carthage and became a statesman, working as a magistrate and attempting to reform the government. He sought to improve Carthage’s financial and political systems, addressing corruption and inefficiency that had contributed to the city's defeat. His reforms, however, made him enemies among the political elite, and he was eventually forced into exile by Roman pressure. Despite this, his time as a statesman showcased his leadership beyond the battlefield and his dedication to Carthage’s recovery.</div>
